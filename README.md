This repo contains templates for the 3 Coursera courses for Golang that the team is taking.  I hope this can be a template for people to keep and track their work indenpent of the Coursera site.

# _Courses

This the base tree with various README's for the courses and associated quizes and projects.  The intent is for individuals to copy to their own user name, and start filling in the answers.  I also hope that people will commit their work to Bitbucket so we can review together.

# _Answers

TBD: will contain answers based on the team input.
