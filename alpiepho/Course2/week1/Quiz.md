Question 3
Letâ€™s say that you are writing a function
which takes a structure as an argument. What is a good reason to rewrite the
function to take a pointer to the structure as an argument, instead of the
structure itself?

1 point

X - The function needs to
modify the structure.


The function needs to
read data inside the structure.


The function needs to
copy the structure.


The structure uses very little space in memory.

Question 4
Which of the features of functions listed below improve code understandability?

I. Low number of arguments

II Performs several distinct tasks

III. Low control-flow complexity

1 point

I and II


X - I and III


II and III


I, II, and III

Question 5
What is a difference
between passing a slice as an argument and passing an array as an argument?

1 point

Passing a slice passes a
copy of all the data in the slice.


Passing an array is faster than passing a
slice.


There is no difference.


X - Passing an array passes a copy of the entire
array.
