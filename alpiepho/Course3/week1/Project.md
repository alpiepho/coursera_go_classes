Answer: 
Moores Law was an observation that the number of transistors on a chip doubles every 2 years.  The implications of this were:
- switch faster so increases computing speed
- that cost of a microchip would drop


This has broken down in recent years due to physical limitations of
- small size changes transistor characteristis
- heat, need to disipate double the heat
- energy, requires double the energy to run
- signal noise
